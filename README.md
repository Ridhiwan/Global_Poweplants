# Global_Powerplants

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is in need of reliable and affordable green power sector. The shift towards cleaner energy that is environmentally sustainable forces us to rethink and reinvent better sources of energy to power our societies. To do this we first have to take a zoomed out look at the sources of energy around the world, the level of dependency towards those sources and their effects on the environment. Governments and companies will now make decisions that will depend on the power sector and its transformation towards green energy. For example, if a carbon tax is to be passed to certain sources of energy then the price of electricity will increase and affect prices of products and thus the economy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this analysis we will use "The Global Plant Database" which is an open source and open access dataset of grid scale(1MW and greater) electricity generating facilities in the world. This dataset consists of the country, name of the power plant, the capacity in megawatts, the latitude and longitude of the plant, the primary fuel for power generation, year of commission, the generated electricity in gigawatt hours and more. We will incorporate the available data into a predictive model that guesses the primary fuel of prospective plant anywhere in the world based on its location, capacity and other parameters available in the data.
